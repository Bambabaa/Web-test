            A mirage of an astronomical object is a naturally occurring optical 
            phenomenon, in which light rays are bent to produce distorted or multiple 
            images of an astronomical object. The mirages might be observed for such 
            astronomical objects as the Sun, the Moon, the planets, bright stars and very
             bright comets. The most commonly observed are sunset and sunrise mirages.

            ALMA Observatory Located in Chile. Plain of Chajnantor that means 
            “Place of Beginning” or “The beginning” in Kunza language. This Astronomical 
            Observatory will open a totally new “window” to the Universe.
            Allowing scientists to unravel important astronomical mysteries of 
            many years. Probe the very first stars and galaxies, and directly 
            capture exoplanets. Possibly discovering the first traces of life.
            ALMA has 66 antennas. Fifty-four of 12 meters in diameter and twelve of 7 meters in diameter.
            The radio telescope combines the signals from each one functioning as 
            an interferometer. With perfect parabolic shapes, of a precision equivalent 
            to only a fraction of the thickness of human hair. It makes them one of the most 
            accurate antennas in the world.
